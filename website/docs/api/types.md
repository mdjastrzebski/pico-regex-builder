### `RegexSequence`

```ts
type RegexSequence = RegexElement[] | RegexElement;
```

The sequence of regex elements forming a regular expression. For developer convenience, it also accepts a single element instead of an array.

### `RegexElement`

```ts
type RegexElement = RegexConstruct | string | RegExp;
```

Regex elements are fundamental building blocks of a regular expression. These can be either further regex constructs, regular strings to be matched literally or `RegExp` literals (`/.../`) for including simple regexes as part of a larger structure.

### `RegexConstruct`

The common type for all regex constructs like character classes, quantifiers, and captures. You should not need to use this type directly, it is returned by all regex construct functions.

Note: the shape of the `RegexConstruct` is considered private and may change in a breaking way without a major release. We will focus on maintaining the compatibility of regexes built with it.
